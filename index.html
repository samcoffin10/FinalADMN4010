    <h2>Company History</h2>
    <p> Sam's Surf Supply was founded in July of 2020 with the goal of sustainably cleaning waste out of ocean and recycling that material into clothing. We started in a small town in New Hampshire, Portsmouth. From there we started out making hats from recycled plastics cleaned out of the ocean, and in the present day just released a new line of Wetsuits. </p>
